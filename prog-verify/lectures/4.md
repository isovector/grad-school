Given prop logic:
- just bools
- constant symbols of bools
- no quantifiers


## Signature I  "ackermannization"

- bools, but now an uninterpreted sort S
- true and false
- infinitely many S
- equality on S

we don't yet know how to solve this

q1) what kinds of models do these formulas have?

  - equivalence relations?
  - which pairs are equal and which aren't?

q2) what features of a model are relevant for deciding M ‚ä® A for some given A?

we could pick a super big model if we wanted to

---

big trick: encode all of the laws of equality with new symbols, conjoin them


## Signature II

- same + many sorts
- infinitely many unary uninterpreted functions
  - whose return sorts are not bools
