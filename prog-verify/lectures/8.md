## E-graph (a theory solver for equality and uninterpreted functions)

Nodes to represent terms, but shared

- For each function application to F, make a new node F, and link it to a node
  for each argument

eg: f(a, b, c), f(b, b, b)

should have f1->a, f1->b, f1->c
        and f2->b, f2->b, f2->b

subject to the idea we have closure over congruence, pairwise on argument
equality


---

WANT TO SOLVE:

  f(b) = b ∨ ¬(f(c) = f(b))
∧ f(b) = f(a) ∨ a = b
∧ ¬(f(c) = b)
∧ a = c ∨ ¬(f(b) = f(a))

then

p = f(b) = b
q = f(c) = f(b)
r = f(b) = f(a)
s = a = b
t = f(c) = b
u = a = c

  p ∨ ¬q
∧ r ∨ s
∧ ¬t
∧ u ∨ ¬r

---

must have:

¬t

so

  p ∨ ¬q
∧ r ∨ s
∧ u ∨ ¬r

choose r

r
¬t

so

  p ∨ ¬q
∧ u

so

choose u
r
¬t

choose p
u
r
¬t

---

p u r t


  f(b) = b
∧ a = c
∧ f(b) = f(a)
∧ f(c) = b


so replace c with a

  f(b) = b
∧ f(b) = f(a)
∧ f(a) = b

now we know f(a) = b, so replace

  f(b) = b

and now we know f(b) = b
unclear if this is a var or a constant

---

we can make an egraph here

  =
f -> b
=
f -> a

f -> c
=
b

a = c


## Skolemization

Replace ∃x:T. A
with   A(subst c for x), given a fresh variable c

only works for positive positions---that is, with an even number of negations
beforehand

when we have ∀x:Int. ∃y: Int. y > x
we want to skolemize to ∃f: Int -> Int. ∀x:Int. f(x) > x


¬¬(∀x:T. ???)
¬∃x. ¬???
