CNF++ conversion pushes negation inwards past quantifiers:

¬ (∀ x. ∃ y. f(x, y) = g(z)) => t(a) = c

turn into Extended CNF
-> atoms = as before
         | ∀-quantified formulas
         (if the quantified is an existential, we can skolemize it)


so it's then
    CNF    = ∧... Clause
    Clause = ∨... Atom
    Atom   = Literal
           | ForallBinder
    ForallBinder = any formula

Definition "ground term"
: no quantified variables

# EMatching
"e" is for equality; this is matching modulo equality

TRIGGERS / PATTERNS

terms that follow certain rules:
  - only uninterpreted function symbols and constants are allowed
  - each variable (from the quantifier) must occur at least once
  - must be at least one non-constant function application

call this a Tpattern ^

then a
  Trigger = TPattern
          | Simultaneous Trigger × TPattern
          | Alternative Trigger Trigger
