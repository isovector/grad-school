SMT solving

- "theories" refer to functions(?)
- they model external aspects; things not expressible in propositional logic

> What is a theory?
unclear exactly, but it's "more than prop logic"


## Three approaches for theory support

1. Eager SMT: desugar all the theories into something that doesn't support the
   surface level domain
2. Lazy SMT: incorporate theory reasoning into the search
3. Model theory: model it as an uninterpreted sort + extra constraints


## Standard elements

Always have the following:

- bools, top and bottom
- for each sort in the signature, we have equality
- for each sort, infinitely many constant symbols of that sort
    (better: we have an finite but arbitrary number)

## What are theories?

a pair:

signature "sig(T)"
a set of models "models(T)"

the models must therefore have everything interpreted from the signature

CONSTRAINTS:

the models must be non-epmty
the domain of the models is the signature
    "they interpret exactly the symbols in the signatures"

> this is confusing to me; ask about it

data Sig : Set₁ where
  interpreted-sort : Set → Sig
  uninterpreted-sort : SORT → Sig
  interpreted-func : {A B : Set} → String → (A → B) → Sig
  uninterpreted-func : {A B : SORT} → String → (⌊ A ⌋ → ⌊ B ⌋) → Sig
  combine : Sig → Sig → Sig


record Theory : Set₁ where
  field
    signature : Sig
    models    : Sig -> Interpretation???


## Examples of Theories

* Equality & Uninterpreted Functions (T_E)
  -- models are every possible interpretation of sorts and fns
* Presburger Arithmetic
  * sig(T_P) = {Int}, {0, 1, +, -, ≤}
  * decidable!
* Nonlinear Arithmetic (T_Z)
  * same, but include multiplication and division
  * "division is very sus -- either NaN or just unconstrained"
  *
  * (what is the interpretation of division???)
* Real Arithemtic
  * same, nbut over the reals


Definition: T-formula
: only functions symbols and sorts from sig(T)

Definition: T-satisfiable
: a T-formula A is T-satisfiable iff:
    ∃[M ∈ models(T)] (M ⊨ A)


## Theory Solver (for some T)

Specification:
- Is a given set of T-literals Γ T-satisfiable
  - if yes, give a model
  - if not, return a small subset that is unsatisfiable

- For a T-satisfiable set of T-literals, are there any implied T-literals?
  - dont GIVE EVERY one

- Are there any implied equalities, given the above?


## DPLL(T)

Now want to reuse DPLL for a given theory T.
How? Replace every T-atom with a new prop literal in Bool
